# Open WebUI - Location Projects

[Our Google Cloud experiments](setup/google-cloud) aim to use only API pipelines so we can avoid CPU use locally.

TO DO: Try Docker command for [omitting Ollama](setup/customize) when writing commands in our [cloud repo](https://github.com/modelearth/cloud) that deploy OpenWebUI to Google Cloud or AWS.

If you're contributing code, here are our steps to [install and build locally](setup/guides) and [more detailed setup notes](setup).  
If you're NOT contributing code while building locally, use the faster [local Docker install](setup/docker) instead.  

To build and contribute locally, you'll skip the local Docker install.

Fork and clone one of our forks:

**“Actions” tabs within our forks:** 
A. [modelearth/open-webui](https://github.com/modelearth/open-webui/actions) - Fresh fork
B. [datascape/open-webui](https://github.com/datascape/open-webui/actions) - Another fork
<!--
C. [earthscape/open-webui-earthscape](https://github.com/earthscape/open-webui-earthscape/actions) - A little broken
-->

Use our "modelearthbranch" so the version number does not need to be incremented.  


## Contribute notes to our Open WebUI "[projects/location](https://github.com/modelearth/projects/)" folder

Our [customize.py script](setup/customize) is used to add our custom code.
Our [sync.py script](setup/customize) removes custom code so we can sync with the parent.

To avoid merge errors, if you're making updates in the "src" and "backend" folders,
append "-team" to the names of the files you've copied and customized.

TO DO: Experiment in our [open-webui-earthscape](https://github.com/earthscape/open-webui-earthscape) fork.


## Our OpenWebUI Projects

For both Datascape and Earthscape, clicking the initial Docker build in Actions was successful.  
Maybe because nothing had changed yet, so it didn't run a memory-consuming build of Ollama.

TO DO: Try using the techniques in “Building Branches Locally” below to eliminate the Actions tab errors.

TO DO: Figure out how to load localsite.js within our clean [Datascape fork](https://github.com/datascape/open-webui/) without generating these [Github Action errors](https://github.com/datascape/open-webui/actions)

    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://model.earth/localsite/js/localsite.js?showheader=true&showsearch=true"></script>

TO DO: Use Flask in a [projects/backend/location](https://github.com/ModelEarth/projects/tree/main/backend) folder and interact with our Supabase REST API - Nanden

TO DO: Create an example of running [Run-Models-bkup.ipynb](https://github.com/ModelEarth/RealityStream/tree/main/models) saved from our [RealityStream CoLab](../../RealityStream/).

TO DO: Set up [RAG context](https://docs.openwebui.com/tutorial/rag/) using our [Supabase International Trade Flow](../../profile/prep/sql/supabase/) data.

TO DO: Set up [RAG context](https://docs.openwebui.com/tutorial/rag/) using our [superthermal evaporation](../../evaporation-kits/) page and related articles.

<!--TO DO: Activate hosting using Cloudflare.-->

TO DO: Provide a means to upload a list of members from a Google Sheet link.

DONE: Provide a button for admins to export the list of members as a CSV file. (In [ModelEarthBranch](https://github.com/ModelEarth/projects/tree/ModelEarthBranch)) - Yuxin

TO DO: Update our Readme in localsite.js to one that supports [NOTE], [WARNING], [TIP]
